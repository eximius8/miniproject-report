# Self-Assembly of Core-Shell nanoparticles

Miniproject report written by me in 2017. Everything left as is - even my comments in code. The project was migrated from [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qghgqkmghdvg#aa6373) here since the report has too many tikz images and overleaf doesn't compile it for free. Compile pdf with github actions in this repo, or [here is the compiled PDF](./main.pdf)


## Grade and feedback

To not include Prof. Engel's signature in this report, I didn't add the page with feedback in the report. However, I got 1.0 - highest grade, and here is Prof. Engel's feedback:

> The miniproject of Mikhail Trunov simulated structure formation in nanoparticles consisting of a solid core and a soft shell. Past work focused on 2d and the aim now was to extend to 3d using a provided event-driven simulation code. The tasks consist of generating scripts, performing simulations, and analysing the data. As the 2d case is already difficult (published in Nature in 2014), this was a challenging problem that required significant computational resources and some ingenuity on how to use them efficiently. Mr Trunov succeed to set up an efficient computing environment and infrastructure involving multiple computers and computer pools.

> Not only was much data collected (four phase diagrams) but also exciting results produced. Although the report does not show it directly, there was a bit of searching in parameter space involved, which demonstrates tenacity on part of Mikhail Trunov. The report is well structured and of good enough quality that it could with some additional effort be converted into a publication. Overall, the project was highly successful and leaves nothing to be desired. In fact, as a next step a new Miniproject student is taking over and, in collaboration with Mikhail Trunov, we aim to completely wrap up this work within the next semester.
