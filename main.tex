%\begin{abstract}
%Core-shell nanoparticles have been extensively studied as potential candidates for a wide range of applications, including bioimaging, sensors, thermometry and more in recent years. Typically a core-shell nanoparticle has a multi-layered structure, consisting of a host core covered by one or several shells. Improvements in computer performance contributed to advances in the behavior of many body particle systems research. The simulation of core-shell nanoparticles has recently revealed interesting 2D structures that particles arrange in, which motivated this work to computationally study many body core-shell nanoparticle systems behavior in three dimensions.

%Self-assembly of core-shell nanoparticles 
%The reasons behind the interest in this material  

%The present work employs event-driven molecular dynamics to study core-shell particle self-assembly. Two simulation approaches are performed. In the first approach the shell potential is slowly being increased while shell-to-core ratio and packing density are kept constant. In the second approach a range of shell-potential vs packing density combinations is simulated at three different shell-to-core ratios. Two new particle crystal configurations are discovered. The first configuration represents modulated body-centered cubic structure. The second found configuration is an icosahedral quasi-crystal.
